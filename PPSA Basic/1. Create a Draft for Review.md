## 1. Create a Draft for Review

Begin by sending a POST request to the appropriate endpoint

```
POST {root}/api/v1/Orders/BasicDischarges
POST {root}/api/v1/Orders/BasicRenewals
```

With a request body in the following format:

```
{
  "referenceNumber": string,
  "jurisdiction": string,
  "country": string,
  "lien": {
    "registrationNumber": string,
    "term": integer,
    "expiryDate": date,
    "isInfiniteTerm": boolean,
    "currentExpiryDate": date,
    "originalRegistrationDate": date,
    "rin": string,
    "fileNumber": string,
    "originalQCFormTypeID": integer | string (enumerated)
  },
  "discharge": {
    "dischargeType": integer | string (enumerated)
  },
  "parties": [
    {
      "busName": string,
      "firstName": string,
      "middleName": string,
      "lastName": string,
      "isEstate": boolean,
      "dateOfBirth": date,
      "partyTypeID": integer | string (enumerated),
      "contactDetails": {
        "email": string,
        "phoneNumber": string,
        "faxNumber": string,
        "address": {
          "streetNumber": string,
          "streetName": string,
          "unit": string,
          "city": string,
          "jurisdiction": string,
          "postalCode": string,
          "countryCode": string
        }
      },
      "linkedParties": [
        {
          "partyLinkType": integer | string (enumerated),
          "linkedParty": party
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Not all fields will be relevant in all jurisdictions. [Please visit the values page for a table listing what fields are relevant in each jurisdiction](https://github.com/Reg-Hub/API/blob/main/PPSA%20Basic/Values.md). It's worth noting that some fields are often not registered, but you may wish to pass them for consistency/record keeping/your own purposes. An example of this for these order types is the phone/fax on the parties. Even though it is almost never actually registered at the registry, it is often provided for clerical purposes.

### Notes on Parties
- Most fields on the party object should be self explanatory, and [please visit the values page for valid enumerated values](https://github.com/Reg-Hub/API/blob/main/PPSA%20Basic/Values.md). The __"linkedParties"__ field of the party object is provided here for completeness, but this field is only relevant in Quebec at this time and you should only use this field if you are instructed to "associate" parties for Quebec registrations.
- When performing basic discharges and renewals, some jurisdictions require you to provide a debtor and/or secured party that is currently registered on the registration as a security measure. Quebec requires you to provide ALL currently registered debtors, secured parties, and dealers. [Please visit the values page for the parties required per jurisdiction](https://github.com/Reg-Hub/API/blob/main/PPSA%20Basic/Values.md).

### Notes on some fields
- You will note from the values page that the field "fileNumber" is used only in Ontario. In ontario, the registration number is far less important than the file number. The file number is used to perform all maintenance filings on the registration, rather than the registration number. Conceptually, you can think of the Ontario file number as the same basic idea as a base registration number.
- Saskatchewan has the concept of a RIN (Registration Identification Number). This is an extra optional security measure that is provided when registering the lien initially. It is required to make any maintenance filings on the registration. If you do not have the RIN, performing a basic renewal or discharge is impossible in Saskatchewan.
- The "dischargeType" field is required for basic discharges in Quebec. The value that should be used depends on the wording of the contract and as a developer, you should be receiving this information from the business side of your organization.

A successful order draft creation response will look like the following example:

Note that not all headers in the response have been provided in the above example as most are irrelevant for the purposes of this guide. Also note that some fields from the response body have been ommitted as they are irrelevant for the purposes of this guide.

Note that the "validations" section contains multiple empty arrays. Validation will be handled in the following section 2.

Once you have created your draft, [it is ready for review and submission](https://github.com/Reg-Hub/API/blob/main/PPSA%20Basic/2.%20Correct%20Any%20Validation%20Issues.md).
