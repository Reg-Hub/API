## 4. Retreive Results

Once your order is in status "Complete" you may retreive results. Results for PPSA registrations are available on the representation of the order itself, or at its document endpoint. The document endpoint will contain a PDF of the verification statement from the registry (or an equivalent document).

For the JSON representation:

```
GET {root}/api/v1/Orders/Liens/{orderID}
GET {root}/api/v1/Orders/RepairLiens/{orderID}
Accept: application/json
```

- The registration number may be found at the path lien.registrationNumber.
- The registration date may be found at the path lien.registrationDate.
- The expiry date may be found at the path lien.expiryDate.
- It is also highly recommended to capture the order group ID from the order object at some point during this entire process, as that is the easiest way to perform maintenance filings (renewals, amendments, discharges) on the registration.

The registry (or equivalent) PDF document may be found at the endpoints:

```
GET {root}/api/v1/Orders/Liens/{orderID}/Results/Document
GET {root}/api/v1/Orders/RepairLiens/{orderID}/Results/Document
Accept: application/json
```

This response will include a JSON object with a base64 encoded version of the pdf included in the field "base64". At the time of this writing (July 8, 2025) we do not support a binary representation of the registry document, but this will be coming soon.
