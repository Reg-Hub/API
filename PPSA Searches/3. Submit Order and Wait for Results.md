## 3. Submit Order and Wait for Results

Once your order no longer has entries in the errors array, it is ready for submission. This is a very simple operation:

```
POST {root}/api/v1/Orders/DebtorSearches/{orderID}/Submit
POST {root}/api/v1/Orders/AssetSearches/{orderID}/Submit
```

Simply send a POST request to the above endpoints with any or no request body. The expected response for success is 204 No Content with no request body.
