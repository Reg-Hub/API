## 3. Submit Order and Wait for Results

Once your order no longer has entries in the errors array, it is ready for submission. This is a very simple operation:

```
POST {root}/api/v1/Orders/DebtorSearches/{orderID}/Submit
POST {root}/api/v1/Orders/AssetSearches/{orderID}/Submit
```

Simply send a POST request to the above endpoints with any or no request body. The expected response for success is 204 No Content with no request body.

Once your order is submitted it will be in the state "Pending". It may fall into a number of other states (notably "Exception") at which point our operations team will intervene in that order in a production environment (note this likely will not happen in testing environments). You may treat any state that is not "Complete" as "I am still waiting for the order to complete." In order to get the current order status, we recommend one of two methods:

### Waiting and Polling

The recommended endpoint to poll for an order's status is 

```
GET {root}/api/v1/Orders/{orderID}/Status
```

which will return a response like so:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
  "status": "Pending"
}
```

See the [values file for a table of typical completion times for these order types](https://github.com/Reg-Hub/API/blob/main/PPSA%20Searches/Values.md). Once the order is in the status "Complete" you may cease polling and retreive results for the order.

### Callback

We do offer callback functionality, but that is beyond the scope of this guide. Please reach out to our team directly if you wish to pursue this route.
