## 4. Retreive Results

Once your order is in status "Complete" you may retreive results. Results for PPSA searches come in a variety of formats. We provide two documents in both JSON and PDF formats.

- The Document is the document retreived from the registry itself.
- The Summary is a version of the Document that has had its complexity reduced into an easier to digest format. This Summary document is generated entirely by RegHub using the parsed registry data. Some registry documents can be huge (hundreds of pages) and the summary is usually somewhere in the 1/3 to 1/4 size range of the registry document. It provides debtor and secured party names, serial asset numbers, high level data (eg. file number, registration number, registration period, trust indenture, etc), general collateral fields, additional information field where supplied by the registry, and amendment details where supplied by the registry.
