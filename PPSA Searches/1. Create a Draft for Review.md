## 1. Create a Draft for Review

Begin by sending a POST request to the appropriate endpoint

```
{root}/api/v1/Orders/AssetSearches
{root}/api/v1/Orders/DebtorSearches
```

With a request body in the format for asset searches:

```
{
  "referenceNumber": string,
  "jurisdiction": string,
  "country": string,
  "asset": {
    "serialNumber": string
  },
  "searchParameters": {
    "exactOnlyResults": boolean
  }
```

Or in the format for debtor searches:

```
{
    "referenceNumber": string,
    "jurisdiction": string,
    "country": string,
    "debtor":
        {
            "busName": string,
            "partyTypeID": number | string
        },
    "searchParameters": {
      "exactOnlyResults": boolean,
      "searchFromDate": date,
      "searchToDate": date
    }
}
```

The following is a brief explanation of the fields:

#### Reference Number
- Type: string
- Description: Can be any string - used for your internal reference only. Can be used to find an order later if you do not have the order ID. Reference numbers do not need to be unique across orders. Every order will end up getting its own unique identifier in its ID field.

#### Jurisdiction
- Type: string
- Max length: 2
- Values: [See Values.md for valid values]()

#### Country
- Type: string
- Max length: 2
- Values: The only valid value (as of writing on July 8, 2025) is "CA" (Canada). We currently do not support PPSA searching outside of Canada.

#### Asset
- Type: object
- Description: Contains information on the asset to be searched for asset searches.

  #### SerialNumber
  - Type: string
  - Description: The serial number (can be a VIN or other format, for example for equipment).
