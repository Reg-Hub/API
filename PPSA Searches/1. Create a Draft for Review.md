## 1. Create a Draft for Review

Begin by sending a POST request to the appropriate endpoint

```
{root}/api/v1/Orders/AssetSearches
{root}/api/v1/Orders/DebtorSearches
```

With a request body in the format for asset searches:

```
{
  "referenceNumber": string,
  "jurisdiction": string,
  "country": string,
  "asset": {
    "serialNumber": string
  },
  "searchParameters": {
    "exactOnlyResults": boolean
  }
```

Or in the format for debtor searches:

```
{
    "referenceNumber": string,
    "jurisdiction": string,
    "country": string,
    "debtor":
        {
            "busName": string,
            "firstName": string,
            "middleName": string,
            "lastName": string,
            'dateOfBirth": date,
            "partyTypeID": number | string
        },
    "searchParameters": {
      "exactOnlyResults": boolean,
      "searchFromDate": date,
      "searchToDate": date
    }
}
```

The following is a brief explanation of the fields:

#### Reference Number
- Type: string
- Description: Can be any string - used for your internal reference only. Can be used to find an order later if you do not have the order ID. Reference numbers do not need to be unique across orders. Every order will end up getting its own unique identifier in its ID field.

#### Jurisdiction
- Type: string
- Max length: 2
- Values: [See Values.md for valid values](https://github.com/Reg-Hub/API/blob/main/PPSA%20Searches/Values.md)

#### Country
- Type: string
- Max length: 2
- Values: The only valid value (as of writing on July 8, 2025) is "CA" (Canada). We currently do not support PPSA searching outside of Canada.

#### Asset
- Type: object
- Description: Contains information on the asset to be searched for asset searches.

  #### SerialNumber
  - Type: string
  - Description: The serial number (can be a VIN or other format, for example for equipment).

 #### Search Parameters
 - Type: object
 - Description: Contains additional search parameters. Not all fields will be available at every jurisdictional registry.

   #### ExactOnlyResults
   - Type: boolean
   - Description: Set to true to only retreive exact matches from the registry. Some registries have a very fuzzy matching scheme and will match even wildly different entries to the criteria provided. If you find you are getting too many results back on your searches for a given jurisdiction, consider setting this to true to only retreive exact matches.
  
   #### SearchFromDate
   - Type: date | null
   - Description: Available in Ontario, sets the maximum date in the past that will be included in the results. We do not recommend using this parameter unless you have a very specific use case for it.

   #### SearchToDate
   - Type: date | null
   - Description: Available in Ontario, sets the maximum date that will be included in the results. We do not recommend using this parameter unless you have a very specific use case for it.
