## 1. Correct Any Validation Issues

We begin with a _similar_ response to that we received when we created our draft in [Section 1: Create A Draft For Review](). However, in this case, we see there are some validation issues (Again, some irrelevant fields and headers have been ommitted from the example).

Note the pressence of items in the "errors" array in the "validation" object.

Orders will not be allowed to be submitted with errors present. Errors _must_ be rectified before submission as the registry will not accept invalid criteria or fields.
