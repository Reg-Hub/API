# PPSA Discharge API Documentation

The following is an integration guide for PPSA Discharges.

A quick note on turnaround times. These can vary wildly from a few seconds to several business days (even weeks in extreme cases). The most common long completion cases will be in Ontario and Quebec. If you request a lien or repair lien order in Ontario outside of business hours, the order cannot be submitted until the next business day (meaning orders requested on Friday night do not get requested until Monday morning). This process is automated so you do not need to worry about resubmitting. The rules in Quebec also result in long completion times. These will almost always be at least a day and in extreme cases (around holidays) could last over a week before the lien is completed. There is no way around this - it is simply the state of the registry in Quebec.
