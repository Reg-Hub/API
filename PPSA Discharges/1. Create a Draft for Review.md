## 1. Create a Draft for Review

Before you can create a draft discharge you need to know the order ID of the most recent filing in the filing's history. This can be the original registration if no maintenance filings have been completed, or the most recent renewal filing, or the most recent amendment filing. At the time of this writing (July 14, 2025) we do not support discharging by order group ID but it is a feature in the road map.

__If you do not know the order ID of the most recent order in the filing's history__, you can search the system by using the GET orders endpoint with some query string parameters based on what you know about the registration.

```
GET {root}/api/v1/Orders
```

The most helpful query string parameters for the purpose of narrowing down the orders query would be

```
referenceNumber
registrationNumber
orderGroupID
```

Note that the above is not an exhaustive list of options for query string parameters, please see the swagger docs for all possible options.

Once you have found the relevant order(s), you'll need to find the most recent. The best way to do this is to pull the order group ID out of one of the orders you've found:

```
{
  ...
  "orderGroup": {
          "id": "518b4d44-1749-4291-5c6b-08ddbf14f287",
          "lastOrderType": "Lien"
      }
  ...
}
```

With the order group ID you can perform the query:

```
GET {root}/api/v1/Orders?orderGroupID={orderGroupID}
```

This will return a list of orders in descending order. You can use the order ID of last order (index n-1) in the returned list to discharge.

```
POST {root}/api/v1/Orders/Liens
POST {root}/api/v1/Orders/RepairLiens
```

With a request body in the following format:

Not all fields will be relevant in all jurisdictions. [Please visit the values page for a table listing what fields are relevant in each jurisdiction](https://github.com/Reg-Hub/API/blob/main/PPSA%20Registrations/Values.md). It's worth noting that some fields are often not registered, but you may wish to pass them for consistency/record keeping/your own purposes. One field commonly used in this way is the __"amount"__ field. Even though it is almost never actually registered at the registry, it is often provided for clerical purposes.

For descriptions/explanations on what each field is/means, please visit the [field descriptions page](https://github.com/Reg-Hub/API/blob/main/PPSA%20Registrations/Field%20Descriptions.md).

Some notes on the party and asset objects. Most fields in the assets and parties objects should be fairly self-explanatory. [Please visit the values page for valid enumerated values](https://github.com/Reg-Hub/API/blob/main/PPSA%20Registrations/Values.md). The __"linkedParties"__ field of the party object is provided here for completeness, but this field is only relevant in Quebec at this time and you should only use this field if you are instructed to "associate" parties for Quebec registrations. The __"reusableRegistryCode"__ may be used in some jurisdictions to avoid explicitly passing all the data for the secured party every time. This may or may not be set up for you at integration time - please reach out to your business team or our ops team to inquire about whether or not you should be using this field. 

A successful order draft creation response will look like the following example:

Note that the "validations" section contains multiple empty arrays. Validation will be handled in the following section 2.

Once you have created your draft, [it is ready for review and submission](https://github.com/Reg-Hub/API/blob/main/PPSA%20Registrations/2.%20Correct%20Any%20Validation%20Issues.md).
