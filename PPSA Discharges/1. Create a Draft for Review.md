## 1. Create a Draft for Review

Before you can create a draft discharge you need to know either the order ID (in the RegHub system) of the most recent filing in the registration's history, or the order group ID (in the RegHub system). If you are using the order ID of the most recent filing, this can be the originalo registration if no maintenance filings have been completed, or the most recent renewal, amendment, or reregistration filing. If you wish to use the order group ID, you can get this off of any of the orders for the registration as it remains unchanged throughout the chain of orders. We strongly recommend just using the order group ID as it will be far easier.

When you wish to discharge a registration, send a request to the endpoint:

```
POST {root}/api/v1/Orders/Discharges
```

With a request body in the following format (either originalOrderID or orderGroupID is required):

```
{
  "referenceNumber": string,
  "originalOrderID": string, //not recommended ID to pass
  "orderGroupID": string, //recommended ID to pass
  "discharge": {
    "dischargeType": integer | string (enumerated)
  }
}
```

Where original order ID is the order ID of the last order in series (the one we went to all the trouble of finding above). The "dischargeType" field is only used in Quebec, and you should ask and receive guidance from your business team/project manager on what value to pass for that. See the [values file](https://github.com/Reg-Hub/API/blob/main/PPSA%20Discharges/Values.md) for all options. Also note the absence of jurisdiction and country. These values are inferred from the filing you are discharging.

A successful order draft creation response will look like the following example:

```
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Location: {root}/api/v1/Orders/491744ca-9f3e-4eb7-65f8-08ddc1670f44

{
    "resource": {
        "id": "491744ca-9f3e-4eb7-65f8-08ddc1670f44",
        "referenceNumber": "your_reference_number",
        "jurisdiction": "BC",
        "country": "CA",
        "orderGroup": {
            "id": "518b4d44-1749-4291-5c6b-08ddbf14f287",
            "lastOrderType": "Discharge"
        },
        "orderTypeID": "Discharge",
        "orderStatusTypeID": "Draft",
        "dateRequested": "2025-07-14T15:41:58.7489621+00:00",
        "discharge": {
            "dischargeNumber": null,
            "dischargeDate": null,
            "dischargeType": null
        }
    },
    "validation": {
        "errors": [],
        "warnings": [],
        "notices": []
    }
}
```

Note that not all headers in the response have been provided in the above example as most are irrelevant for the purposes of this guide. Also note that some fields from the response body have been ommitted as they are irrelevant for the purposes of this guide.

Note that the "validations" section contains multiple empty arrays. Validation will be handled in the following section 2.

Once you have created your draft, [it is ready for review and submission](https://github.com/Reg-Hub/API/blob/main/PPSA%20Discharges/2.%20Correct%20Any%20Validation%20Issues.md).
